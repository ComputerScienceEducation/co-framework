Pioneering computers like ENIAC, UNIVAC, and IBM 701 were built in 1945, 1951, and 1952, featuring memory sizes of 20 KB, 1000 KB, and 2048 KB.
The x86_64 architecture, also known as AMD64, was introduced by AMD in 2000 as an extension to the 32-bit x86, increasing the word size to 64 bits and supporting up to 16 EB of memory.
